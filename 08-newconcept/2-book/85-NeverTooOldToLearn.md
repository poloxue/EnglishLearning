# Never Too Old to Learn

Audio: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VFFZbmDl4g

I have just received a letter from my
old school
informing me that my former headmaster
mr stuart page
will be retiring next week
pupils of the school old and new
will be sending him a present to mark
the occasion
all those who have contributed towards
the gift will sign their names in a
large album which will be sent to the
headmaster's home
we shall all remember mr page for his
patience and understanding
and for the kindly encouragement he gave
us
when we went so unwillingly to school
a great many former pupils will be
attending a farewell dinner in his honor
next thursday
it is a curious coincidence that the day
before his retirement
mr page will have been teaching for a
total of 40 years
after he has retired
he will devote himself to gardening
for him this will be an entirely new
hobby
but this does not matter
for as he is often remarked
one is never too old to learn
