# Out of the Limelight

Audio: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gefg1nmaLU0

an ancient bus stopped by a dry riverbed and a party of famous actors and actresses got off
dressed in dark glasses and old clothes
they had taken special precautions so
that no one should recognize them
but as they soon discovered
disguises can sometimes be too perfect
this is a wonderful place for a picnic
said gloria gleam
it couldn't be better gloria
brinksley mia's agreed
no newspaper men no film fans
why don't we come more often
meanwhile
two other actors
rockwall slinger and merlin greaves
had carried two large food baskets to a
shady spot under some trees
when they had all made themselves
comfortable a stranger appeared
he looked very angry
now you get out of here all of you
he shouted
and sheriff here
do you see that notice
it says
no camping
in case you can't read
look sheriff said rock hall
don't be too hard on us
i'm rock wall slinger
and this is merlin greaves
oh is it said the sheriff with a sneer
well i'm bringsley mears and my other
name is gloria gleam
now you get out of here fast
