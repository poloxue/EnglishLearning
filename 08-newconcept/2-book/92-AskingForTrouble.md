# Asking for Trouble

Audio: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x-HEKiTLqA

it must have been about two in the
morning when i returned home
i tried to wake up my wife by ringing
the doorbell
but she was fast asleep
so i got a ladder from the shed in the
garden
put it against the wall
and began climbing towards the bedroom
window
i was almost there when a sarcastic
voice below said
i don't think the windows need cleaning
at this time of the night
i looked down and nearly fell off the
ladder when i saw a policeman
i immediately regretted answering in the
way i did
but i said
i enjoy cleaning windows at night
so do i
answer the policeman in the same tone
excuse my interrupting you
i hate to interrupt a man when he's busy
working but
would you mind coming with me to the
station
well i prefer to stay here
i said
you see i've forgotten my key
your what
he called
key
i shouted
fortunately the shouting woke up my wife
who opened the window just as the
policeman had started to climb towards
me
