# Thirsty Ghost

Course: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFdVV70Zg8Y

A public house which was recently bought by Mr. Ian Thompson is up for sale. Mr. thompson is going to sell it because it is haunted.

He told me that he could not go to sleep one night because he heard a strange noise coming from the bar. The next morning he found that the doors had been blocked by chairs and the furniture had been moved. Though Mr. Thompson had turned the lights off before he went to bed, they were on in the morning. He also said that he had found five empty whiskey bottles which the ghost must have drunk the night before.

When I suggested that some villagers must have come in for a free drink, Mr. Thompson shook his head. The villagers have told him that they will not accept the pub even if he gives it away.
