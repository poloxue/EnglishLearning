# A Dead Return

Audio: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MESWQ3ey0GM

a festival for the dead is held once a
year in japan
this festival is a cheerful occasion
for on this day
the dead is said to return to their
homes and they are welcomed by the
living
as they are expected to be hungry after
their long journey
food is laid out for them
specially made lanterns are hung outside
each house
to help the dead to find their way
all night long
people dance and sing
in the early morning
the food that had been laid out for the
dead is thrown into a river or into the
sea
as it is considered unlucky for anyone
living to eat it
in towns that are near the sea
the tiny lanterns which had been hung in
the streets the night before
are placed into the water when the
festival is over
thousands of lanterns slowly drift out
to sea guiding the dead on their return
journey to the other world
this is a moving spectacle
for crowds of people stand on the shore
watching the lanterns drifting away
until they can be seen no more
