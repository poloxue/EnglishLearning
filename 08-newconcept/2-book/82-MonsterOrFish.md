# Monster or Fish

Audio: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7iYn5HNrUY

fishermen and sailors sometimes claim to
have seen monsters in the sea
though people have often laughed at
stories told by semen
it is now known that many of these
monsters
which have at times been sighted
are simply
strange fish
occasionally
unusual creatures are washed to the
shore but they are rarely caught out at
sea
some time ago however
a peculiar fish was caught near
madagascar
a small fishing boat was carried miles
out to sea by the powerful fish as it
pulled on the line
realizing that this was no ordinary fish
the fishermen made every effort not to
damage it in any way
when it was eventually brought to shore
it was found to be over 13 feet long
it had a head like a horse big blue eyes
shining silver skin
and a bright red tail
the fish
which has since been sent to a museum
where it is being examined by a
scientist
is called an or fish
such creatures have rarely been seen
alive by man
as they live at a depth of 600 feet
