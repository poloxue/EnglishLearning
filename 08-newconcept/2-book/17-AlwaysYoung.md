# Always young

My aunt, Jennifer, is an actress. She must be at least 35 years old. In spite of this, she often appears on the stage as a young girl.

Jennifer will have to take part in a new play soon. This time she will be a girl of seventeen in the play. She must appear in a bright red dress and long black stockings. Last year in another play, she had to wear short socks and a bright orange coloured dress.

If anyone ever asks her how old she is, she always answers, "Darling. It must be terrible to be grown up!".
