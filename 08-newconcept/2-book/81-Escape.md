# Escape

when he had killed the guard, the prisoner of war quickly dragged him into the bushes
working rapidly in the darkness
he soon changed into the dead man's
clothes
now
dressed in a blue uniform and with a
rifle over his shoulder
the prisoner marched boldly up and down
in front of the camp
could hear shouting in the camp itself
lights were blazing and men were running
here and there
they had just discovered that a prisoner
had escaped
at that moment
a large black car
with four officers inside it stopped at
the camp gates
the officers got out
and the prisoner stood to attention and
saluted as they passed
when they had gone
the driver of the car came towards him
the man
obviously wanted to talk
he was rather elderly with gray hair and
clear blue eyes
the prisoner felt sorry for him
but there was nothing else he could do
as the man came near
the prisoner knocked him to the ground
with a sharp blow
then jumping into the car he drove off
as quickly as he could
