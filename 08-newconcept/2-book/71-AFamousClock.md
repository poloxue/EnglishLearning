when you visit london, one of the first things you will see is Big Ben. The famous clock which can be heard all over the world on the BBC if the houses of parliament had not been burned down in 1834.

The great clock would never have been erected. Big Ben takes its name from sir benjamin hall who was responsible for the making of the clock when the new houses of parliament were being built. It is not only of immense but is extremely accurate as well. Officials from greenwich observatory
have the clock checked twice a day
on the bbc
you can hear the clock when it is
actually striking
because microphones are connected to the
clock tower
big ben has rarely gone wrong
once however it failed to give the
correct time
a painter who had been working on the
tower
hung a pot of paint on one of the hands
and slowed it down
