# After the Elections

Audio: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hbe6un8MylA

the former prime minister mr wentworth Lane
was defeated in the recent elections
he is now retiring from political life
and has gone abroad
my friend patrick has always been a
fanatical opponent of mr lane's radical
progressive party
after the elections
patrick went to the former prime
minister's house
when he asked if mr lane lived there
the policeman on duty told him that
since his defeat
the ex-prime minister had gone abroad
on the following day
patrick went to the house again
the same policeman was just walking
slowly past the entrance
when patrick asked the same question
though a little suspicious this time
the policeman gave him the same answer
the day after
patrick went to the house once more and
asked exactly the same question
this time the policeman lost his temper
i told you yesterday
and the day before yesterday
he shouted
mr lane was defeated in the elections
he has retired from political life
and gone to live abroad
i know
answered patrick
but i love to hear you say it
