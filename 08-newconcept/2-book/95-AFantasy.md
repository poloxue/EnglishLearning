when the ambassador of escalopia
returned home for lunch
his wife got a shock
he looked pale
and his clothes were in a frightful
state
what has happened she asked
how did your clothes get into such a
mess
a fire extinguisher my dear
answered the ambassador dryly
university students set the embassy on
fire this morning
good
heavens
exclaimed his wife
and where were you at the time
i was in my office as usual
answered the ambassador
the fire broke out in the basement
i went down immediately of course
and that fool horst
aimed a fire extinguisher at me
he thought i was on fire
i must definitely get that fellow posted
the ambassador's wife went on asking
questions
when she suddenly noticed a big hole in
her husband's hat
and how can you explain that
she asked
oh that
said the ambassador
someone fired a shot through my office
window
accurate don't you think
fortunately i wasn't wearing it at the
time
if i had been
i would not have been able to get home
for lunch
