# Out of Control

as the man tried to swing the speed boat
round
the steering wheel came away in his
hands
he waved desperately to his companion
who had been water skiing for the last
15 minutes
both men had hardly had time to realize
what was happening
when they were thrown violently into the
sea
the speedboat had struck a boy but it
continued to move very quickly across
the water
both men had just begun to swim towards
the shore
when they noticed with dismay that the
speedboat was moving in a circle
it now came straight towards them at
tremendous speed
in less than a minute
it roared past them only a few feet away
after it had passed
they swam on as quickly as they could
because they knew that the boat would
soon return
they had just enough time to swim out of
danger when the boat again completed a
circle
on this occasion however
it had slowed down considerably
the petrol had nearly all been used up
before long
the noise dropped completely
and the boat began to drift gently
across the water
