# Breakfast or Lunch

Audio: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSHn8_BBWjc

It was sunday. I never get up early on sundays. I sometimes stay in bed until lunch time.

Last sunday, I got up very late. I looked out of the window. It was dark outside.

'What a day!' I thought, 'It's raining again.'

Just then, the telephone rang. It was my aunt, Lucy. 

'I've just arrived by train.' she said, 'I'm coming to see you.'

'But i'm still having breakfast', I said.

'What are you doing?' she asked.

'I'm having breakfast.' I repeated.

'Dear me!', she said, 'do you always get up so late? It's one o'clock.'
