# By Air

I used to travel by air a great deal when i was a boy.
my parents used to live in south america
and i used to fly there from europe in
the holidays
a flight attendant would take charge of
me and i never had an unpleasant
experience
i'm used to traveling by air
and only on one occasion have i ever
felt frightened
after taking off
we were flying low over the city
and slowly gaining height
when the plane suddenly turned round and
flew back to the airport
while we were waiting to land
a flight attendant told us to keep calm
and to get off the plane quietly as soon
as it had touched down
everybody on board was worried
and we were curious to find out what had
happened
later we learned that there was a very
important person on board
the police had been told that a bomb had
been planted on the plane
after we had landed
the plane was searched thoroughly
fortunately nothing was found and five
hours later we were able to take off
again
