children who play truant from school
are unimaginative
a quiet days fishing or eight hours in a
cinema seeing the same film over and
over again
is usually as far as they get
they have all been put to shame
by a boy who while playing truant
travelled sixteen hundred miles
he hitchhiked to dover
and towards evening
went into a boat to find somewhere to
sleep
when he woke up next morning
he discovered that the boat
had in the meantime traveled to calais
no one noticed the boy as he crept off
from there
he hitchhiked to paris in a lorry
the driver gave him a few biscuits and a
cup of coffee and left him just outside
the city
the next car the boy stopped did not
take him into the center of paris as he
hoped it would
but to pepino on the french spanish
border
there he was picked up by a policeman
and sent back to england by the local
authorities
he has surely set up a record for the
thousands of children who dream of
evading school
