I crossed the street to avoid meeting him but he saw me and came running towards me. It was no use pretending that I had not seen him, so I waved to him. I never enjoy meeting Nigel Dykes. He never has anything to do. No matter how busy you are, he always insists on coming with you. I had to think of a way of preventing him from following me around all morning.

'Hello, Nigel.' I said, 'Fancy meeting you here.'

'Hi, Elizabeth,' Nigel answered, 'I was just wondering how to spend the morning until i saw you. You're not busy doing anything are you?"

'No, not at all.' I answered, 'I'm going to ...'

'Would you mind my coming with you?' he asked before I had finished speaking.

'Not at all,' I lied, 'but I'm going to the dentist.'

'Then I'll come with you.' he answered, 'There's always plenty to read in the waiting room.'
