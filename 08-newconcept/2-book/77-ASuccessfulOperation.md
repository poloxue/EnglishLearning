Audio: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDQzxrjauls

the mummy of an egyptian woman who died
in 800 bc
has just had an operation
the mummy
is that of shephen mutt
who was once a singer
in the temple of thebes
as there were strange marks on the x-ray
plates taken of the mummy
doctors have been trying to find out
whether the woman died of a rare disease
the only way to do this was to operate
the operation which lasted for over four
hours
proved to be very difficult
because of the hard resin which covered
the skin, the doctors removed a section of the
mummy and sent it to a laboratory
they also found something which the
x-ray plates did not show
a small wax figure
of the god do a mutef
this god
which has the head of a cow
was normally placed inside a mummy
the doctors have not yet decided how the
woman died
they feared that the mummy would fall to
pieces when they cut it open
but fortunately this has not
happened the mummy successfully survived
the operation
