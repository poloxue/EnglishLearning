# Three Mean in a Basklet

Audio: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppN1RPHauL8

a pilot
noticed a balloon which seemed to be
making for a royal air force station
nearby
he informed the station at once
but no one there was able to explain the
mystery
the officer in the control tower was
very angry when he heard the news
because balloons can be a great danger
to aircraft
he said that someone might be spying on
the station
and the pilot was ordered to keep track
of the strange object
the pilot managed to circle the balloon
for some time
he could make out three men in a basket
under it
and one of them was holding a pair of
binoculars
when the balloon was over the station
the pilot saw one of the men taking
photographs
soon afterwards
the balloon began to descend
and it landed near an
airfield the police were called in
but they could not arrest anyone
for the basket contained two members of
parliament
and the commanding officer of the
station
as the commanding officer explained
later
one half of the station did not know
what the other half was doing
