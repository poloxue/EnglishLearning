It crashed in the mountains and its pilot was killed
the only passengers
a young woman
and her two baby daughters were unhurt
it was the middle of winter
snow lay thick on the ground
the woman knew that the nearest village
was miles away
when it grew dark
she turned a suitcase into a bed
and put the children inside it
covering them with all the clothes she
could find
during the night it got terribly cold
the woman kept as near as she could to
the children
and even tried to get into the case
herself
but it was too small
early next morning
she heard planes passing overhead
and wondered how she could send a signal
then she had an idea
she stamped out the letters s
o s
in the snow
fortunately a pilot saw the signal and
sent a message by radio to the nearest
town
it was not long before a helicopter
arrived on the scene to rescue the
survivors of the plane crash
