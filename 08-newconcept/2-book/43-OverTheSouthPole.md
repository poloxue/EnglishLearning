# Over the South Pole

In 1929, three years after his flight over the North Pole, the American explorer R.E Bird successfully flew over the south pole for the first time. Though at first, Bird and his men were able to take a great many photographs of the mountains that lay below. They soon ran into serious trouble.

At one point, it seemed certain that their plane would crash, it could only get over the mountains if it rose to ten thousand feet. Bird at once ordered his men to throw out two heavy food sacks, the plane was then able to rise and it cleared the mountains by 400 feet.

Bird now knew that he would be able to reach the South Pole which was 300 miles away for there were no more mountains in sight. The aircraft was able to fly over the endless white plains without difficulty.
