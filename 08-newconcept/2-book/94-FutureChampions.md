experiments have proved that children
can be instructed in swimming at a very
early age
at a special swimming pool in los
angeles
children become expert at holding their
breath underwater even before they can
walk
babies of two months old do not appear
to be reluctant to enter the water
it is not long before they are so
accustomed to swimming
that they can pick up weights from the
floor of the pool
a game that is very popular with these
young swimmers
is the underwater tricycle race
tricycles are lined up on the floor of
the pool
seven feet underwater
the children compete against each other
to reach the other end of the pool
many pedal their tricycles
but most of them prefer to push or drag
them
some children can cover the whole length
of the pool without coming up for breath
even once
whether they will ever become future
olympic champions only time will tell
meanwhile
they should encourage those among us who
cannot swim five yards before they are
gasping for air
