# The Last One

after reading an article entitled
cigarette smoking and your health
i lit a cigarette to calm my nerves
i smoked with concentration and pleasure
as i was sure that this would be my last
cigarette
for a whole week i did not smoke at all
and during this time
my wife suffered terribly
i had all the usual symptoms of someone
giving up smoking
a bad temper
and an enormous appetite
my friends kept on offering me
cigarettes and cigars
they made no effort to hide their
amusement
whenever i produced a packet of sweets
from my pocket
after seven days of this
i went to a party
everybody around me was smoking and i
felt extremely uncomfortable
when my old friend brian urged me to
accept a cigarette
it was more than i could bear
i took one guiltily
lit it
and smoked with satisfaction
my wife was delighted that things had
returned to normal once more
anyway
as brian pointed out
it is the easiest thing in the world to
give up smoking
he himself has done it lots of times
