at the time the murder was committed
i was traveling on the eight o'clock
train to london
said the man
do you always catch such an early train
asked the inspector
of course i do
answered the man
i must be at work at 10 o'clock
my employer will confirm that i was
there on time
would a later train get you to work on
time
asked the inspector
i suppose it would
but i never catch a later train
at what time did you arrive at the
station
at 10 to 8
i bought a paper
and waited for the train
and you didn't notice anything unusual
of course not
i suggest
said the inspector
that you are not telling the truth
i suggest that you did not catch the
eight o'clock train
but that you caught the 8 25
which would still get you to work on
time
you see
on the morning of the murder
the eight o'clock train did not run at
all
it broke down at fern green station and
was taken off the line
