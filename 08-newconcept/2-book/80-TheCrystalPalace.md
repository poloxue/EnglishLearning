Perhaps the most extraordinary building of the 19th century was the crystal palace which was built in hyde park for the great exhibition of 1851. 

the crystal palace was different
from all other buildings in the world
for it was made of iron and glass
it was one of the biggest buildings of
all time
and a lot of people from many countries
came to see it
a great many goods were sent to the
exhibition from various parts of the
world
there was also a great deal of machinery
on display
the most wonderful piece of machinery on
show
was nasmith's steam hammer
though in those days traveling was not
as easy as it is today
steamboats carried thousands of visitors
across the channel from europe
on arriving in england they were taken
to the crystal palace by train
there were six million visitors in all
and the profits from the exhibition were
used to build museums and
colleges later
the crystal palace was moved to south
london
it remained one of the most famous
buildings in the world
until it was burnt down in 1936
