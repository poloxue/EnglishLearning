# A Car Called Bluebird

Audio: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBtU80pW36k

the great racing driver sir malcolm campbell
was the first man to drive at over 300
miles per hour
he set up a new world record in
september
1935 at bonneville salt flats utah
bluebird
the car he was driving
had been specially built for him
it was over 30 feet in length
and had a 2
500 horsepower engine
although campbell reached a speed of
over
304 miles per hour
he had great difficulty in controlling
the car
because a tire burst during the first
run
after his attempt
campbell was disappointed to learn that
his average speed had been
299 miles per hour
however
a few days later
he was told that a mistake had been made
his average speed had been
301 miles per hour
since that time
racing drivers have reached speeds over
600 miles an hour
following in his father's footsteps many
years later
sir malcolm's son
donald
also set up a world record
like his father he was driving a car
called blue bird
