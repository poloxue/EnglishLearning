# Trapped in Mine

Audio: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDfeo7seRok

Six men have been trapped in a mine for
17 hours
if they are not brought to the surface
soon they may lose their lives
however rescue operations are proving
difficult
if explosives are used
vibrations will cause the roof of the
mine to collapse
rescue workers are therefore drilling a
hole
on the north side of the mine
they intend to bring the men up in a
special capsule
if there had not been a hard layer of
rock beneath the soil
they would have completed the job in a
few hours
as it is
they have been drilling for 16 hours and
they still have a long way to go
meanwhile
a microphone which was lowered into the
mine two hours ago
has enabled the men to keep in touch
with their closest relatives
though they are running out of food and
drink
the men are cheerful and confident that
they will soon get out
they have been told that the rescue
operations are progressing smoothly
if they knew how difficult it was to
drill through the hard rock
they would lose heart
