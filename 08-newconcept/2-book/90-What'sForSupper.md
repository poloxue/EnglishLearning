# What's for Supper

fish and chips
has always been a favorite dish in
britain
but as the oceans have been overfished
fish has become more and more expensive
so it comes as a surprise to learn that
giant fish are terrifying the divers on
north sea oil rigs
oil rigs have to be repaired frequently
and divers
who often have to work in darkness
a hundred feet under water
have been frightened out of their wits
by giant fish bumping into them as they
work
now they have had special cages made to
protect them from these monsters
the fish are not sharks or killer whales
but favorite eating varieties like cod
and skate
which grow to unnatural sizes
sometimes as much as 12 feet in length
three factors have caused these fish to
grow so large
the warm water around the hot oil pipes
under the sea
the plentiful supply of food thrown
overboard by the crews on the rigs
the total absence of fishing boats
around the oil rigs
as a result the fish just eat and eat
and grow and grow in the lovely warm
water
who eats who
