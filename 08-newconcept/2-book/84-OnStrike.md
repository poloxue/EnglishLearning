Audio: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ds2A4C6J3qA

burstmen have decided to go on strike
next week
the strike is due to begin on tuesday
no one knows how long it will last
the bus men have stated that the strike
will continue until general agreement is
reached about pay and working conditions
most people believe that the strike will
last for at least a week
many owners of private cars are going to
offer free rides to people on their way
to work
this will relieve pressure on the trains
to some extent
meanwhile
a number of university students have
volunteered to drive buses while the
strike lasts
all the students are expert drivers
but before they drive any of the buses
they will have to pass a special test
the students are going to take the test
in two days time
even so people are going to find it
difficult to get to work
but so far
the public has expressed its gratitude
to the students in letters to the press
only one or two people have objected
that the students will drive too fast
