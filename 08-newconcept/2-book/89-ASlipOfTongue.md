# A Slip of Tongue

people will do anything to see a free
show
even if it is a bad one
when the news got round that a comedy
show would be presented at our local
cinema
by the p and u birdseed company
we all rushed to see it
we had to queue for hours to get in and
there must have been several hundred
people present just before the show
began
unfortunately the show was one of the
dullest we have ever seen
those who fail to get in need not have
felt disappointed as many of the
artistes who should have appeared did
not come
the only funny things we heard that
evening came from the advertiser at the
beginning of the program
he was obviously very nervous
and for some minutes stood awkwardly
before the microphone
as soon as he opened his mouth
everyone burst out laughing
we all know what the poor man should
have said
but what he actually said was
this is the poo
and e-seed bird company
good ladies evening and gentlemen
